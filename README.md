# REBL_UI
Simple menu UI for Arduino with 16x2 LCD, rotary encoder, and a single button


REBL_UI

The REBL_UI offers a simple way to build a user interface with a Rotary Encoder, a Button, and an LCD.  Currently 
it is set up for 16x2 LCD, but could easily be changed to whatever.  It includes a very simple and easy to set up
menu system and several functions to facilitate using the encoder and button with minimal code on the user’s part.  
Debouncing and edge detection are handled by the class.  

There are several headers in the REBL_UI folder that handle different parts of the interface.  REBLInterface has 
the code for the button and encoder.  REBLDisplay has code to handle the display.  The user code never touches 
the LCD, it only interacts with this code.  So changing an LCD is as simple as rewriting a little code in this one 
class.  There is a copy of my MenuClass and an implementation of it called REBLMenu.  There is also a header for 
some useful functions in building a UI.  


REBLDisplay.h
This header includes code to interact with the display.  Currently it allows you to print to buffers that it will 
display to the screen, control the backlight, and control the cursor.  The current implementation is for an LCD 
with an RGB backlight with a 595 shift register controlling the data pins and a library I wrote that controls the 
whole thing using the SPI interface.  LiquidCrystal_SPI_8Bit.h (at my github page).  The code will easily change 
to support the normal LiquidCrystal library by simply changing the include and the initLCD function to call the right 
begin method.  



void initLCD(byte aRsPin, byte aEnablePin, byte aRedPin, byte aGreenPin, byte aBluePin);
Sets up the pins and calls begin for the LCD.  Call this function from setup before trying to do anything with the 
display.  See LiquidCrystal_SPI_8Bit library documentation for description of RS pin and Enable pin.  The others are 
for the backlight.  If you have a monochromatic LCD, then just set them all to the same pin you used for the backlight 
and use any color to turn the LCD on and BLACK to turn it off.  

void setColor(color_vars color);
Sets the color of the backlight to a selection from the color_vars enum.  
The choices are:  {BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, PURPLE, CYAN, WHITE}.  

void doDisplay();
Causes the contents of the display buffers to be written out to the LCD.  There should be some delay between 
consecutive calls or the screen will flash.  It is generally called from loop with a “Blink Without Delay” style timer.  

void displayLineLeft(int row, const char* message);
void displayLineRight(int row, const char* message);
These functions put text into the display buffers to be displayed on the screen in left or right justified manner.  
These functions will fill any unused space in the buffer with spaces and the functions will truncate any strings 
too long to fit.  The functions are overloaded to take __FlashStringHelper* so they’re F macro friendly.  These are 
the functions you’ll mostly use from your code to write to the screen.

void displayTextLeft(int row, int startcol, int colwidth, const char* message);
void displayTextRight(int row, int startcol, int colwidth, const char* message);
These functions also put text into the display buffers, but only operate on a piece of the buffer instead of writing 
the entire line.  They will always fill at least colwidth characters and will use spaces if the text isn’t long enough 
in left or right justified manner but will leave other text in the buffer unchanged.  These functions are also 
overloaded with __FlashStringHelper* versions so they are F macro friendly.  

void setCursor(byte row, byte column);
void showCursor(boolean cursorOn);
These allow you to control the cursor from your code without touching the LCD code.  

Hidden Secret:  There is a define in the REBLDisplay.h file that will allow you to send the LCD output to the serial 
monitor instead along with info about the cursor and screen color.  It makes for easy debugging when the gizmo with 
the LCD is not close to the computer. 

See the example code for some examples of using these functions to control the display.




REBLInterface.h
This header contains code to interact with the button and rotary encoder as well as some convenience functions for 
doing user interface type things with them.  Both the encoder and button have an on/off setting and when turned off 
will not register presses or turns.  This is handy to avoid the first update to a menu scrolling a thousand lines down 
and selecting something random because you turned the encoder a bunch before you entered the menu.  When off, the button 
will always return unpressed and the encoder will always return zero change. 

void initInterface(byte buttonPin, byte encoderInterruptPin, byte encoderBPin);
Sets up the pins and starts the interface working.  Should be called once from setup before interacting with the button 
or encoder.  Does NOT turn the button or encoder on, those functions must also be called before using.  Currently, the 
encoderInterruptPin can be any pin on the Arduino that supports hardware interrupts (pins 2 and 3 on UNO).  It will not 
work with pin change interrupts without some changes to the code. 

void buttonOn();  void buttonOff();  void encoderOn();  void encoderOff(); 
Turn on and off the reading of the button and encoder.

boolean isEncoderOn();  boolean isButtonOn();
Return true is the device is active.  

char checkRotaryEncoder();
Returns the change in position of the encoder since the last time it was read.  Negative numbers one way and positive 
numbers the other.  

void useRotaryEncoder(T& var, int multiplier = 1);
Updates the variable var using the rotary encoder.   If the multiplier is set to 0, then it only increments or decrements 
var by one no matter how far the encoder turned.  If the multiplier is set higher, then it does the obvious and multiplies 
the change before applying it.  The variable is passed by reference, so the real variable from the calling code will be 
updated. 

void useRotaryEncoder(T& var, T minimum, T maximum, int multiplier = 1);
Same as above but includes limit checking. 

void useRotaryEncoderASCII(char& var);
Similar to useRotaryEncoder but gets values from a table of asci values instead of numbers.  Handy for inputting strings. 

boolean checkButton();   
Return true if the button has been pressed and released.  Clears the flag so subsequent calls will return false until the 
button has been pressed again.  If you need to use it more than once, read it into a variable and use that. 
boolean checkButtonLongPress();
Return true if the button has been pressed and held for a defined time.  Similar caveat to checkButton.  


REBLMenu.h

REBLMenu is an implementation of my MenuClass which is specialized for working with the REBL_UI.  Menu items are created 
as structs containing display text and a function pointer.  The functions called by the menu should take no arguments and 
return boolean.  The boolean is to allow for the code in these functions to be non-blocking and allows these functions 
to be called repeatedly from loop via the doMenu() method.  The functions should return false if they need to be called 
again and true if they are ready to return control to the menu.  Small functions or intentionally blocking functions 
should simply return true.  Please see the example code for a better idea.  
Menu items are put into MenuList objects which represent the individual menus.  The currently active menu is selected 
through the setMenu method.  MenuLists should be placed in PROGMEM.  There is a #define in the source for MenuClass 
that will allow you to have the items in SRAM, but this is best avoided except in test cases.  

void doMenu();
This method should be called frequently from a tight loop while the menu is active.  This method advances the menu, 
handles selection, handles display, handles calling any functions that are selected from the menu.  

boolean isCancelled();
In the REBL_UI, a long press (greater than 2 sec) will register the cancel flag and allow you to write code to cancel 
out of processes or functions.  

void setCurrentMenu(MenuList* aList);
This method sets the currently active menu.


Rebl_Functions:
This header contains some pre-canned useful functions for doing things like entering strings and setting the time.  
Expect additions as I find need for functions in my code.   Please see the source and example code for their use.  

Please see the following code for an example using this interface.  This example creates a simple menu that shows off 
each function of the library.   This also shows an example of how to write non-blocking functions for use with the menu.  
Blocking functions could simply return true at the end.
